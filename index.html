        <p class="mainbodtxt">Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time...a long time. I
            think my uncle
            knew him. He said he was dead. Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet. You know him! Well of course, of course I
            know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born. Then the droid does
            belong to you. Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting... I think we better get
            indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers. Threepio!
            Where am I? I must have taken a bad step... Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the
            Sandpeople return. I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking
            yourself on my account. I'm done for. No, you're not. What kind of talk is that? Quickly, son...they're on
            the move. </p>
        <p class="mainbodtxt">Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. What's this? What is what?!? He asked you a
            question... What
            is that? Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Oh, he
            says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old data. Pay it no mind. Who is she? She's beautiful. I'm
            afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi... I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A
            person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to... Is there more to this recording?
            Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new
            master.</p>
